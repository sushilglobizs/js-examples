Typescript is a super set of Javascript

Typescript: Microsoft

This is not a programming language.

This is just Javascript on steroids. Super Javascript.

Developer friendly.

Javascript programs usually have a lot of bugs due to carelessness or laziness of developers.

But Typescript makes sure there are no such bugs.
